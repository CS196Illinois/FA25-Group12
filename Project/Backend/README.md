# Calculating Expected Annual Return Using CAPM Model 
We have written out the code for calculating the expected return. Feel free to run the code and input the stocks you want.

-------

## Features 

- Calculating the Annual Expected Return of stock *i* using CAPM
- Calculating the actual Compound Annual Growth Rate of stock *i* with historical data

## Notes
- Historical data means data from 5 years
- You can input multiple stocks, one at a time, and it prints the return for each stock you input.
- Rf: using the U.S. 10-year Treasury annual return
- Rm: using S&P 500 index annual return
